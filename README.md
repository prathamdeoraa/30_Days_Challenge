### **How I’d Personally Study Each Day**

1. **First 1–2 hrs:** Read docs & watch short tutorial for concept
2. **Next 3–5 hrs:** Implement the concept in code + mini challenges
3. **Last 2–3 hrs:** Combine into mini-project, test, debug, commit to GitHub
4. **Optional:** Write notes / short summary for memory retention
